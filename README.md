## Car Fuel Efficiency Prediction

I have used Auto MPG dataset, which is a common machine learning
benchmark dataset for predicting the fuel efficiency of a car in MPG. The full
dataset and its description are available from UCIâ€™s machine learning
repository at:

This is a practice project for regression tasks using a neural network.
